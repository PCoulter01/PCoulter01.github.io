  Personal Website
</h1>

<p>
  A single-page personal <a href="patrickcoulter.me" target="_blank"> portfolio </a> used to show off my skills as a full-stack developer.
</p>

<p>
  This was made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has different pages like Home page, About page, Projects page and Contact page. Also has buttons for my blog and support sites. It has transition animations and a menu to switch from light and dark mode. It's Mobile and Tablet friendly also.
