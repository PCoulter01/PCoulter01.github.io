## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)
Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution.**

I value keeping this site open socure,, but we all know **plagiarism is bad.**

It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent hours of my oown time building and designing my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Please also note that I did not build this site with the intention of it being a starter theme, so if you have questions about implementation, I recommend referring to the [Astrojs Docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/).
